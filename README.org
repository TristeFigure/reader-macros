* Motivation  
  Let's see if we can't inspire a few [[http://briancarper.net/blog/449/][pitchforks]] with a reader-macro
  package for Clojure.

  May Zeus forgive us for opening this [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandora's_box][πίθος]], &c.

* Usage
  We tried to stay close to the semantics of [[http://clhs.lisp.se/Body/f_set_ma.htm][set-macro-character]] and
  [[http://clhs.lisp.se/Body/f_set__1.htm][set-dispatch-macro-character]]:

  - =(set-macro-character character function)= :: Associates a
       reader-macro with =character=, where =function= has the
       signature =(fn [stream character] ...)=.
       
       Issuing e.g. =(set-macro-character \[ f)= will cause the reader
       to call =(f stream \[)= when it encounters =[=.
  - =(set-dispatch-macro-character character function)= :: Associates
       a dispatch-macro with =character=, where =function= has the
       signature =(fn [stream character] ...)=.
       
       Dispatch-macros are distinguished from reader-macros in that
       they are activated by the dispatch prefix =#=; issuing
       e.g. =(set-dispatch-macro-character \[ f)=, therefore, will
       cause the reader to call =(f stream \[)= when it encounters
       =#[=.

  To define a reader macro, for instance, that reverses strings; try:

  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
    (use 'clojure.string)
    
    (set-macro-character \"
     (fn [reader quote]
       (reverse (macro-read-string reader quote))))
    
    (println "hello, reader macros")
    => sorcam redaer ,olleh
  #+END_SRC
  #+END_QUOTE

  We've also exposed a few utility functions from
  =clojure.lang.LispReader= to help extract things from readers:

  - =read-arg=
  - =read-character=
  - =read-comment=
  - =read-deref=
  - =read-discard=
  - =read-dispatch=
  - =read-eval=
  - =read-fn=
  - =read-list=
  - =read-map=
  - =read-meta=
  - =read-quote=
  - =read-regex=
  - =read-set=
  - =read-string=
  - =read-syntax-quote=
  - =read-unmatched-delimiter=
  - =read-unquote=
  - =read-unreadable=
  - =read-vector=
  - =read-var=
